                <h1>Introduction</h1>
            </header>
            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive
                (e.g.,
                having complex animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.). There are also more advanced server
                side
                versions of JavaScript such as Node.js, which allow you to add more functionality to a website than
                downloading
                files (such as realtime collaboration between multiple computers). Inside a host environment (for
                example, a web
                browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control
                over
                them.</p>


            <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of
                language
                elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a
                variety of
                purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its
                    Document
                    Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an
                    HTML
                    form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>
                <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript
                    on a
                    server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database,
                    provide
                    continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file
                    manipulations
                    on a server.</li>
            </ul>

                <h1>JavaScript and Java</h1>
            </header>
            <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript
                language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript
                follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the
                reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>

            <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime
                system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values.
                JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The
                prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual
                objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can
                be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.</p>

            <p>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables,
                classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or
                protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types
                are not explicitly typed. </p>

                <h1>Hello World</h1>
            </header>
            <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Web Console in multi-line mode, and write your first
                "Hello world" JavaScript code: </p>
            <div class="code-color">    
                <code>

                function greetMe(yourName) {

                  alert('Hello ' + yourName);

                }
                
                greetMe('World');
            
            </code>
        </div>
            <p>Press <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd> Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> (or click the Run button) to watch it unfold in your browser!</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
            <header>
                <h1>Variables</h1>
            </header>
            <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called
                identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>

            <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($). Subsequent
                characters can also be digits (0–9).</p>

            <p> Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) as well
                as "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>
            <div class="code-color">
                <code>
                    var myStr = "string";
                    var myNum = 10;
                </code>
            </div>

            <p> You can use most of ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. (For more details, see
                this blog post.) You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers.</p>

            <p> Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, $credit, and _name.

            <div class="code-color">    

            <code>const PI = 3.14;
            </code>
            </div>
            <p>A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is running. It must
                be initialized to a value.</p>

            
            <p> You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope. For
                example:</p>
            <div class="code-color">    
            <code>
            // THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR 
            function f() {};
            const f = 5;
            </code>
            </div>
            <p> The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block-scope variables. If the const keyword
                is omitted, the identifier is assumed to represent a variable.</p>

            <div class="code-color">
            <code>
            // THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR TOO
            function f() {
              const g = 5;
              var g;
            
              //statements
            }
            </code>

                <h1>Data Types</h1>
            </header>
            <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines eight data types:

            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Seven data types that are primitives: </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Boolean. true and false. </li>
                    <li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. (Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is
                        not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.)
                    </li>
                    <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is not defined.
                    </li>
                    <li>Number. An integer or floating point number. For example: 42 or 3.14159.
                    </li>
                    <li>BigInt. An integer with arbitrary precision. For example: 9007199254740992n.
                    </li>
                    <li>String. A sequence of characters that represent a text value. For example: "Howdy"
                    </li>
                    <li>Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>and Object</li>
            </ul>
